[**Autohotkey**](http://ahkscript.org) is an awesome little scripting language to automate and simplify all things Windows.\
**a2** helps getting AutoHotkey scripts, updating them, and developing your own.

Basically, a2 is an **Autohotkey runtime** that you can conveniently configure with a Graphical User Interface (GUI based on [Qt for Python](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python)).

See [the Wiki](https://github.com/ewerybody/a2/wiki) for more information especially:
* [How to use a2](https://github.com/ewerybody/a2/wiki/How-to-use-a2).
* [How to develop a2](https://github.com/ewerybody/a2/wiki/How-to-develop-a2).

The features in this runtime are introduced via **modules** bundled in **packages**. Each module can have various script files and is presented with its own configuration frontend to setup shortcuts, variables etc. These frontends are comprised of reusable elements that developers can easily arrange.
